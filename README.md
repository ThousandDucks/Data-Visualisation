# Project Overview

This project analyses the market value of football players in Serie A in the 2023/2024 season, exploring how factors like position, sub position, and performance metrics (goals, assists) influence player market value. Data visualisation was done in accordance to the INF4000 Data Visualisation module requirements.

### Key Questions:
- Who are the most valuable players in Serie A?
- How do market values vary across positions and sub-positions?
- What is the relationship between player performance and market value?

- Download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.
- Save the data to a folder called "data" in the main project directory (the same directory as the .Rproj file).
